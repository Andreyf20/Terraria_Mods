# Setup

This needs dotnet SDK 8 installed `$ yay dotnet-sdk-8`. Make sure to restart terraria so it detects the version.

## Nvim lsp

csharp_ls needs latest version of dotnet sdk installed `$ yay dotnet-sdk`.

Another options is using omnisharp and only using sdk version 8. Randomly seems that it started working,
maybe it is needed to have the latest dotnet version installed. It is showing warnings and documentation properly.
